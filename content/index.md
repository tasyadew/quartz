I should start writing instead of fancying up my digital garden.

I fall back into the trap of decorating the notebook to the very ✨*aesthetic*✨ instead of taking the actual note. 😞 

...

Anyways, this is my digital note taking space. Feel free to take a look around. I used to study [[Computer Graphics]] and doing [[Data Engineering]] projects. Currently, I'm self studying [[Calculus]] and [[Machine Learning]]. I am no mean an expert, and I may make a few mistakes in my understanding of a concept. Feel free to reach me out to discuss or correct me.

Sincerely, Tasya 🐧
